# Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm **Samuel Guillot**, a passionate tech enthusiast currently studying at **42 Paris**. My journey hasn't always been this wayâ€”I started with a background in accounting, auditing, and finance. I hold a Master's degree in Accounting and Auditing, with professional experience in banking and accounting expertise. However, I found my true passion in technology, and after completing the common core curriculum at **42 Paris**, Iâ€™m now specializing in **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, **SQL**, and much more. My goal is to push the boundaries of what I can do, including building my own **neural network** from scratch! I am always excited about new challenges and love exploring how technology can be used to solve real-world problems.

## Tech Stack âœ¨
Here are a few of the technologies and skills Iâ€™m working with:
- **Programming Languages**: C, C++, Python
- **Machine Learning**: Neural Networks, Deep Learning, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Data Science**: Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Pandas, NumPy
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, React, Django
- **DevOps & Containers**: Docker
- **Database**: SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Others**: Prompting, Git, Data Engineering

## My Current Goals ðŸ”­
- **Machine Learning**: Currently re-creating my own neural network to better understand the fundamentals.
- **Hackathons**: Participating in as many hackathons as possible to challenge myself and learn.
- **Data**: Exploring new ways to handle and analyze large datasets to extract valuable insights.
