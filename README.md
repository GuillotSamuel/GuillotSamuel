# Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

Hi! I'm **Samuel Guillot**, a passionate tech enthusiast currently studying at **42 Paris**. My journey hasn't always been in tech—I initially built a background in accounting, auditing, and finance. I hold a Master's degree in Accounting and Auditing, with professional experience in banking and accounting expertise. However, I eventually found my true passion in technology. After completing the common core curriculum at **42 Paris**, I’m now specializing in **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, and more.

After completing the common core at 42 Paris, I specialized in **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, and **MLOps**. My focus today is building predictive models, automating data pipelines, and applying AI to solve real-world challenges.

## 💻 Tech Stack ✨
Here are a few of the technologies and skills I’m working with:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C, C++, Javascript
- **Machine Learning**: Neural Networks, Deep Learning, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Data Science**: Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, React, Django, Next.js
- **DevOps & Containers**: Docker, AWS, Ansible
- **Database**: SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Others**: Git, N8N

## 🚀 Projects & Achievements
🏠 **Rental Scoring SaaS (2025)** – Automated the analysis of rental applications: OCR extraction, document validation, scoring algorithm, and cloud deployment (Next.js + AWS).
🧠 **Multilayer Perceptron** – Built a neural network from scratch to deepen understanding of forward/backpropagation and gradient descent.
🐍 **Learn to Slither** – Reinforcement learning project where an agent learns to play Slither.io using policy optimization.
🌍 **GeoAI Hack Challenge** – Finalist (2025) – Developed an AI model to detect locust breeding zones from satellite imagery.

## 🎯 My Current Goals 🔭
- Improve my skills in quantitative modeling and ML.
- Keep challenging myself through hackathons and real-world ML projects.

## 😄 Fun Fact
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me either tackling a mountain on my bike or hiking through the trails, pretending I’m not getting lost. If I’m not outdoors, I’m usually glued to my computer, writing code, debugging, or daydreaming about the next big project to dive into—always looking for new ways to make the world more efficient with data and AI! 🚀
