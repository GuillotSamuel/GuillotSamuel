# Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

Hi! I'm **Samuel Guillot**, a passionate tech enthusiast currently studying at **42 Paris**. My journey hasn't always been in tech—I initially built a background in accounting, auditing, and finance. I hold a Master's degree in Accounting and Auditing, with professional experience in banking and accounting expertise. However, I eventually found my true passion in technology. After completing the common core curriculum at **42 Paris**, I’m now specializing in **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, **SQL**, and more.

My goal is to push the limits of what I can achieve, including building my own neural network from scratch. I thrive on new challenges and love discovering how technology can be applied to solve real-world problems.

## 💻 Tech Stack ✨
Here are a few of the technologies and skills I’m working with:
- **Programming Languages**: C, C++, Python
- **Machine Learning**: Neural Networks, Deep Learning, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Data Science**: Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Pandas, NumPy
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, React, Django
- **DevOps & Containers**: Docker
- **Database**: SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Others**: Prompting, Git, Data Engineering

## 🎯 My Current Goals 🔭
- **Machine Learning**: Currently re-creating my own neural network to better understand the fundamentals.
- **Hackathons**: Participating in as many hackathons as possible to challenge myself and learn.
- **Data**: Exploring new ways to handle and analyze large datasets to extract valuable insights.

## 😄 Fun Fact
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me either tackling a mountain on my bike or hiking through the trails, pretending I’m not getting lost. If I’m not outdoors, I’m usually glued to my computer, writing code, debugging, or daydreaming about the next big project to dive into—always looking for new ways to make the world more efficient with data and AI! 🚀
